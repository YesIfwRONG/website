# Serena's website
I decided to create my website all of a sudden. As I don't have time every day, and this is my random thought late at night 12 am, I guess I'll keep it simple and write down my todos for future implementations.

## Todo:
- Basic front-end stuff.
- Nice UI for the website.
- Color Patterns.
- AWS or Firebase?
- UI for me to input all the random thoughts in a day, and automatically update on the website.

## Conclusion:
Wish you have a nice day.
