# Serena's website
I decided to create my website all of a sudden. As I don't have time every day, and this is my random thought at late night 12 am, I guess I'll keep it simple and write down my todos for future implementations.

## Guide:
This repository contains two folders - java-web and svelte-web - meaning two implementations of my website. Each folder should be a complete project in the future.

## Java-web Todo:
Haven't decided yet... 

## Svelte Todo:
- Basic front-end stuff.
- Nice UI for the website.
- Color Patterns.
- AWS or Firebase?
- UI for me to input all the random thoughts in a day, and automatically update on the website.
